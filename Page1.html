          is an acronym that stands for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. It is used as a guide to create accessible websites for people with disabilities. 
          Perceivable means it would be easy to identify elements on the page whether it be through sight, touch, or sound. Operable means the webpage is easy to navigate the page for people with
          disabilities. Understandable means the webpage has easily learned functionality and that the functionality of the page is consistent. Robust means that the webpage is able to work on all 
          devices the user may be using. In general, POUR is used to create a functional webpage for all types of users in mind.</h2>

          <h1>How this page uses Accessibility features</h1>
          <h2>This site uses the elements from <a href = "#pour">POUR</a>. It is easy to identify elements on the page. It is easy to navigate the page whether you are using a mouse or just a keyboard.
          The page's functionality is consistent throughout. It can be viewed on any manner of devices due to flexbox implementation. Other Accessibility features include: jump to main content link,
          using fieldset and labels for the form, using scope for the table, using alt text on images, and a very high contrast ratio.</h2>
